## Getting Started

These are instructions for opening the game as a project in Unity.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Unity version 2020.1.0a25 or newer to properly run this project. I recommend using Unity Hub:

```
https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
```

### Installing

Use Unity to open the unzipped project and it will take care of the rest.

## Build and Run

To export a version of the game you can use Unity's Build and Run option

```
File -> Build settings or ctrl+shift+b
```

Ensure the scenes are in the correct order

```
_Scenes/Menu 0
_Scenes/Main 1
```

Make sure WebGL is selected or PC standalone for easier testing

Then select Build or Build And Run
